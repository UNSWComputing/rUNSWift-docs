**Press the chest button once.** The chest led should turn on. Booting is complete when the chest starts flashing red quickly.

.. warning::
    *   Don't move the robot while its starting up, as the IMU is calibrated during boot.
    *   Don't hold down the chest button, as this will cause the robot to start flash!
