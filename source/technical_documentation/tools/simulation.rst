3D Simulation
#############


********
Overview
********

Simulation allows for safe, quick testing of experimental code and settings,
and can help you practice using the code without having to leave your desk.


3D Simulation can be used for developing
    - Behaviours
    - Motion
    - Localisation
    - Support Tools

It cannot be used for developing
    - Vision


.. tip::
    Breaking simulated robots is a lot cheaper than breaking real ones!

For previous simulator see here: TODO
we haven't got it working with ROS2, but also nobody has tried so give it a go
We kinda tried webots and isaacsim, maybe rviz?
