Instructions for dual booting. This step is unnecessary if you have
a suitable linux OS already installed.

#.  Create an empty disk partition. This will vary depending on your current
    OS, and hence is not covered in this guide.

    .. tip::
        Allocate at least 50GB storage


#.  Create a bootable USB and install linux on the empty partition,
    as described `here <https://www.linuxtechi.com/ubuntu-18-04-lts-desktop-installation-guide-screenshots/>`_ (note this guide is for v18 but it should also work for v22)
