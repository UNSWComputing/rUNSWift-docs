Turning Robot On
################

**Press the chest button once.** The chest led should turn on. Booting is complete when the chest starts flashing red quickly.

.. warning::
    *   Don't move the robot while its starting up, as the IMU is calibrated during boot.
    *   Don't hold down the chest button, as this will cause the robot to start doing a factory reset!

.. seealso::
    :ref:`button_presses` for other button presses.
