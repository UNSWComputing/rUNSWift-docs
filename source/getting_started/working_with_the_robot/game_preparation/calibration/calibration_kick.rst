Kick Lean
#########

Each robot has slightly different motion dynamics, and require a lean offset when kicking, to kick reliably.

Instructions

In this example, we will use a robot with the head of mario and body of yoshi.

========= =========
Head name Body name
========= =========
mario     yoshi
========= =========

#.  Ensure ``bodyName`` is correct in ``image/home/nao/data/configs/mario.cfg``.

    .. code-block:: cfg

        [player]
        bodyName=yoshi

    .. note::
        Replace ``mario`` and ``yoshi`` with your robot's head and body names

#.
    To run the kick calibration procedure for the **left foot**,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ runswift --calibration.kick 1 --kick.foot LEFT --kick.leanOffsetL 0.0

    To run the kick calibration procedure for the **right foot**,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ runswift --calibration.kick 1 --kick.foot RIGHT --kick.leanOffsetR 0.0

#.  Place a ball in front of robot's kicking foot. Robot will kick the ball.

#.  Modify the ``leanOffsetL`` and ``leanOffsetR`` value until the kick doesn't fallover sideways.

    .. note::
        ``kick_lean_offset`` is in **degrees**. Increments of 1.0 degrees is recommended for initial tuning, and 0.5 degrees for finer tuning. The value can be positive or negative (as seen in the example config below).

    .. tip::
        **Increase** ``kick_lean_offset`` to make the robot **lean more** onto the support foot, and vice versa.


#.  Copy the tuned ``leanOffsetL`` and ``leanOffsetR`` into ``image/home/nao/data/configs/body/yoshi.cfg``

    .. code-block:: cfg

        [kick]
        leanOffsetL=1.0
        leanOffsetR=-2.0

    .. note::
        Replace ``yoshi`` with your robot's body names


#.  Repeat the corresponding procedure for each foot.
